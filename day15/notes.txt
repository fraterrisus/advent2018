Units
  hit_points (HP)
  attack_power (AP)

Reading order: standard (0,0) - (10,0) then (0,1) - (10,1)

Round loop
  Each unit completes its actions before the next unit goes
  1. move into range
    a. identify all possible target units; if empty, game over
    b. if I'm already adjacent to a target unit, skip to step 2
    c. find all open floor square adjacent to target units that aren't occupied
    d. find the shortest paths to all target squares
       this eliminates unreachable targets
       if the list is empty, skip to step 2
    e. pick a target square, breaking ties in reading order
    f. move one step closer to the target square, breaking ties in reading order
  2. attack enemy
    a. identify all adjacent target units
    b. select the one with the lowest HP, breaking ties in reading order
    c. target HP -= my AP; if target HP <= 0, target dies and is removed from the board
