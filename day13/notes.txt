1. The initial board consists of
  - |      straight lines (horiz, vert.)
  / \      curves (cars change facing when they *enter*)
  +        intersections (places where two straight lines meet)
  > < v ^  cars sitting on a straight piece of track

2. When a car enters a curve, it changes facing.

3. When a car enters an intersection, it changes facing based on the following program:
  1st: turn left
  2nd: go straight (do not change facing)
  3rd: turn right
  -back to top-

4. A tick is resolved from top (left-to-right) to bottom.
